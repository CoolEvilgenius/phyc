Listed above are candidate genes thought to be associated with the evolution of vancomycin intermediate resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (VISA). [MRSA] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus) (methicillin-resistant *S. aureus*) is a common hospital-associated bacterial pathogen that often causes dangerous infections. [Vancomycin] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancomycin) is a glycopeptide antibiotic commonly used to treat MRSA. We recently sequenced the genomes of 75 VISA and VSSA (vancomycin senstive) MRSA strains and scored each gene in each strain for rare mutations. The level of antibiotic resistance was determined using two methods: [Etest](http://www.biomerieux-diagnostics.com/etest) and [PAP-AUC](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3020420/). In this app you can select different combinations of genes to model a genome sequence based diagnostic for the VISA phenotype. If a gene is selected, any rare mutations present in a strain result in positive classification for VISA.  (We focus on rare mutations on the basis of the *a priori* assumption that VISA is a rare phenotype in the species.) Three mutations in the *rpoB* and *stp* genes that are known to cause VISA from previous genetic studies are built into the model - all strains with these loci are assumed positive. The app returns **accuracy** (true positive + true negative/ all outcomes) and **sensitivity** (true positve/ true positive + false negative) of the selected model. The **upper plot** shows distribution of the VISA/VSSA strain calls from the perspective of the model predictions (left) and true phenotypes (right). In the **lower plot** each strain is an individual circle with its level of resistance to the drug plotted against the of number mutations called by the model.  From these data a regression of how each mutation increases the level of resistance is calculated. The regression plot (lower figure) shows the **regression line (red)** and the **VISA threshold (dashed blue)**. Using the sliders you can also see how the model is affected by changing how we define VISA and VSSA based on the results of antibiotic resistance tests.
